# LiveScript.tmbundle
A [TextMate](http://macromates.com), Sublime Text and Chocolat bundle for [LiveScript](http://gkz.github.com/LiveScript/), fork of [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org).

Initially based on coffeescript.tmbundle.

## Installation

Pop open your favorite shell and run...

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
    git clone git://github.com/paulmillr/LiveScript.tmbundle.git
    osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'

It's fine if TextMate is open.
